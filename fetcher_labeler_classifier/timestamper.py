# the purpose of this class is to try and assign to each article a date that corresponds to the major event covered in the article.
# A trivial way would be to just extract the date of writing of the article. A more complicated way would be to analyze the temporal references
# in the text to guess which one refers to the maor event. If we manage to extract a list of events referenced in the text, then maybe
# we could do the same trick as with the keywords: let the graph decide for itself what events are related (if they are mentioned across
# Articles for example)
