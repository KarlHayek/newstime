# NewsTime

A website that displays the news in timelines where events are sorted chronologically in timelines that correspond to their topic. Live deployment of the website: https://newstime437.herokuapp.com

The website made using NodeJS and ExpressJS, and using MongoDB for the database.

To run the web app execute the commands `node install` and `node app.js`
Note: For now the database is local

Dependencies: NodeJS, MongoDB

And that's the wayy the news goes.
